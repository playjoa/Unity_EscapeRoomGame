1. Introduction
----------------------------------------

Hello and welcome to the documentation of Polygon Arsenal. Here you’ll find some information on how to most efficiently use and customize the asset for your project.

If you’re ready to dive right in, most effects can be found in the 'Polygon Arsenal/Prefabs' folder. Here they are sorted into 3 main categories: Combat, Environment and Interactive.

To view an effect, you can simply drag and drop it into your Scene and the effect will start playing immediately.

You can also more efficiently browse effects directly in Unity by adding all the demo scenes from the ‘Polygon Arsenal/Demo/Scenes’ folder into the Build Settings, open one of the scenes and press Play.

While in the Game window you can click through the in-game button row at the bottom to navigate to
the different scenes.

----------------------------------------
2. Scaling Effects
----------------------------------------

To scale an effect while it is inside a scene, you can simply use the default Scale Tool. You can also select the effect and type in your new Scale in Transform in the Inspector. In most cases you will want to keep the scale uniform. If the scale is not uniform, meshes used for the effects may appear to be skewed.

The effects in Polygon Arsenal consists almost entirely out of Particle Systems which have their Scaling Mode set to Hierarchy. This lets you scale the effects easily without having to change the Start Size values on multiple sub-particle systems.

This does however mean that some parts of the effects such as Point Lights, Trail Renderers and Audio Sources may have to be manually adjusted afterwards if you scale an effect, as Transform does not affect them.

----------------------------------------
3. Upgrading to URP
----------------------------------------

When you import Polygon Arsenal for the first time, the asset will be using Shaders for the Built-in Render Pipeline (often called Standard). If you are planning to work in Standard, upgrading is not necessary.

Before upgrading, make sure your project is configured to use the LWRP (Lightweight Render Pipeline) or URP (Universal Render Pipeline).

WARNING: Any changes made to Materials in the Polygon Arsenal folder will be lost when upgrading!

To upgrade to LWRP/URP, locate the 'Polygon Arsenal\Upgrades' folder, then open (double-click) and Import the bundled 'Polygon Arsenal URP' unitypackage to your project. This will replace all of the Materials in the asset folder, and make some minor changes to Scenes and Prefabs in the ‘Polygon Arsenal\Demo’ folder.

You can also revert to Standard materials by re-importing the pack from the Asset Store.

4. Common Problems
----------------------------------------

URP Texture Bug (2019.3)

If you have trouble with particles looking like brightly lit quads in URP after using the 2019.3 URP Upgrade, follow these steps to get the textures working again:

1. In the Package Manager, make sure you are at least using Universal RP 7.2.0 (or higher)
2. In the Project folder search for "_ADD" to list all the additive materials in the Polygon Arsenal folder
3. Select all of them and set Blending Mode to Additive.

---

URP Missing or Invisible Particles

In some cases it may look like there are missing or invisible parts of the effects. This is because certain Materials have Soft Particles enabled. These will not be rendered unless Depth Texture is enabled on the Camera. An alternative would be to disable Soft Particles on each individual Material.

----------------------------------------
5. ASSET EXTRAS
----------------------------------------

In the 'Polygon Arsenal/Scripts' folder you can find some neat scripts that may further help you customize the effects.

PolygonStaticBeam - A script for making a quick beam effect.

PolygonLightFade - This lets you fade out lights which are useful for explosions

PolygonPitchRandomizer - Randomizes the pitch of sounds, and can help make repetetive sounds less annoying.

PolygonRotation - A simple script that applies constant rotation to an object

PolygonSoundSpawn - A handy script for playing sounds which destroys itsself after the sound is over
